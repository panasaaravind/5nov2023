        <h1>World Cup Points Table</h1>
        <p>Cricket World Cup Points table : In the Cricket World Cup and many other cricket tournaments, teams earn points based on their performance in the matches they play. The most common points system in cricket tournaments is as follows:

        <p>Pakistan are still alive in their hunt for a place in the semifinals following an unbelievable DLS, rain-marred win over New Zealand yesterday. The win keeps PAK at 5, just a position below NZ at 4, while India continued to lead the points table, followed by South Africa at 2 and Australia at 3. The win has really intensified the equation as there's a four-way battle involved with just two spots for up grabs. Australia, Pakistan and New Zealand are all in the fray. And technically, as are Afghanistan. Pakistan need to beat England in their final league game, and the BlackCaps need to do the same against Sri Lanka. If both win, whoever has a higher NRR will qualify. Afghanistan have a tall ask at hand with their next two matches being against Australia and South Africa. As well as they've played, beating both teams looks tough.
